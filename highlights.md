**Highlights**

Flyers with more information on the BISICLES and MALI ice sheet models can be found here: [BISICLES](https://e3sm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ResearchHighlight_BISICLES.pdf), [MALI](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/sites/default/files/technical-highlights/TechnicalHighlight_MALI.pdf)

*ProSPect* ice sheet models will ultimately contribute to DOE's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). More information can be found at the E3SM [homepage](https://e3sm.org/).

DOE Office of Science [did a story on ice sheets, our project, and how *ProSPect* fits in with the broader E3SM project.](https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/simulating-ice-bottom-world-modeling-antarctic-ice-sheets) 

Congratulations to Irina Tezaur (Sandia Nationial Laboratories) who is a 2019 [Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE)](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/articles/11-nnsa-employees-receive-highest-honor-early-career-scientists-and-engineers?fbclid=IwAR1gVTwdoJhEG5MD9bbjvT3KRN6qVVQtL5HSrQr8ds6-wfLH4n5_CHIyzew) recipient. Irina's work on the development of MALI under the SciDAC [PISCEES](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/predicting-ice-sheet-and-climate-evolution-extreme-scales-piscees) project is noted in her award citation (see additional links [here](https://www.sandia.gov/~ikalash/_assets/Communicator.html) and [here](https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-perry-congratulates-recipients-presidential-early-career-award-scientists-and)).   

BISICLES was featured on the cover of *Geophysical Research Letters*, [volume 46, no. 3](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/grl.57643).

A press release for the [ISMIP6 LARMIP paper](https://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/11/35/2020/esd-11-35-2020.pdf), which both BISICLES and MALI contributed simulations to, can be found [here](https://www.egu.eu/news/605/the-antarctica-factor-model-uncertainties-reveal-upcoming-sea-level-risk/).  

Press releases for the broader ISMIP6 project that ProSPect contributed to in numerous ways can be found here, from [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/emissions-could-add-15-inches-to-2100-sea-level-rise-nasa-led-study-finds) and here, from [LANL](https://int.lanl.gov/news/news_stories/2020/september/0921-ice-sheets.shtml).  

In collaboration with the [E3SM Cryosphere Simulation Campaign](https://e3sm.org/research/cryosphere-ocean/) and with support from DOE's Data Management Program we worked with members of SciDAC's [RAPIDS institute](https://rapids.lbl.gov/) on a number of [scientific visualizations](https://e3sm.org/scientific-visualization-of-e3sms-cryosphere-campaign-simulations/) exploring ice sheet and ocean interactions in the Earth system. This work culminated in a [finalist entry to the 2020 Supercomuting Scientific Visualization competition](https://youtu.be/Wt0TvNjYsOs).  

Most of our high-performance computing is done at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/about/), where our work has been highlighted in [2018](https://www.nersc.gov/assets/Science-Highlights-Presentations/NERSC-Highlights-2018-3-FINAL.pdf), [2019](https://www.nersc.gov/assets/Science-Highlights-Presentations/NERSC-Science-Highlights-R20191016.pdf), and [2020](https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlights-presentations/).

In May of 2021, a [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03302-y) was published that includes ProSPect contributions to the ISMIP6 project. The press release from the lead instituation at Kings College London can be found [here](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/limit-global-warming-to-1.50c-and-halve-the-land-ice-contribution-to-sea-level-this-century). [LANL](https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2021/May/0505-antarctica-sea-level.shtml) and [LBNL](https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-news/science-news/2021/limit-global-warming-to-1-5c-and-halve-the-land-ice-contribution-to-sea-level-this-century) also issued their own press releasese highlighting this work.
