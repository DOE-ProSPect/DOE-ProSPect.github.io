Changes to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet over recent decades have contributed to sea-level rise at an accelerating rate and present the largest potential for future changes in sea-level. Accurate sea-level projections require simulations of ice sheet evolution using next-generation ice sheet models coupled to Earth-System Models (ESMs), but current limitations prohibit such projections. 

The U.S. Department of Energy ([DOE](https://energy.gov/)) has invested in the development of advanced ice sheet models (BISICLES and MPAS-FELIX) that place increased resolution in regions experiencing the largest and most rapid changes. Building from these investments, the multi-institutional  *ProSPect* project aims to remove current deficiencies in order to allow for probabilistic projections of sea-level change using DOE ice sheet and ESMs. 

*ProSPect* was launched in 2017 under DOE’s Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing ([SciDAC](http://www.scidac.gov/)) program, a partnership between DOE’s Advanced Scientific Computing Research ([ASCR](https://science.energy.gov/ascr/)) and Biological and Environmental Research ([BER](https://science.energy.gov/ber/)) Offices. *ProSPect* has three major foci: ice-sheet model physics and coupling, initialization and uncertainty analysis, and ice-sheet model performance on next-generation, high-performance computing (HPC) architectures.
