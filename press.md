BISICLES was featured on the cover of *Geophysical Research Letters*, [volume 46, no. 3](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/grl.57643).

DOE Office of Science [did a story on ice sheets, our project, and how it fits in with parts of the E3SM project.](https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/simulating-ice-bottom-world-modeling-antarctic-ice-sheets) 

Congratulations to Irina Tezaur (Sandia Nationial Laboratories) who is a 2019 [Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE)](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/articles/11-nnsa-employees-receive-highest-honor-early-career-scientists-and-engineers?fbclid=IwAR1gVTwdoJhEG5MD9bbjvT3KRN6qVVQtL5HSrQr8ds6-wfLH4n5_CHIyzew) recipient. Irina's work on the development of MALI under the SciDAC [PISCEES](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/predicting-ice-sheet-and-climate-evolution-extreme-scales-piscees) project is noted in her award citation (see additional links [here](https://www.sandia.gov/~ikalash/_assets/Communicator.html) and [here](https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-perry-congratulates-recipients-presidential-early-career-award-scientists-and)).   

A press release for the [ISMIP6 LARMIP paper](https://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/11/35/2020/esd-11-35-2020.pdf), which both BISICLES and MALI contributed simulations to, can be found [here](https://www.egu.eu/news/605/the-antarctica-factor-model-uncertainties-reveal-upcoming-sea-level-risk/).  

Press releases for the broader ISMIP6 project that ProSPect contributed to in numerous ways can be found here, from [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/emissions-could-add-15-inches-to-2100-sea-level-rise-nasa-led-study-finds) and here, from [LANL](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/emissions-could-add-15-inches-to-2100-sea-level-rise-nasa-led-study-finds).
